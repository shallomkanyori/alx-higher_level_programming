- This task will include checks for the efficiency of your solution.
Write a funciton in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it and returns `0` if there is no cycle or `1` if there is a cycle. Only these functions are allowed: `write`, `printf`, `putchar`, `puts`, `malloc`, `free`.


**Task 11: Hello, write.**
