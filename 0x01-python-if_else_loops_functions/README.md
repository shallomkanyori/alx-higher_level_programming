## Python - if/else, loops, functions

**Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing.**
Complete the source code of a program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` and prints whether the number stored in `number` is positive or negative.

**Task 1: The last digit.**
Complete the source code that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` and prints the last digit of the number stored in `number` as well as whether it is greater than 5, less than 6 and not 0, or is 0.

**Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game.**
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- You can only use one `print` function with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

**Task 3: When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off.**
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- Print all the letters except `q` and `e`
- You can only use one `print` function with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

**Task 4: Hexadecimal printing.**
Write a program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal.
- You can only use one `print` function with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

**Task 5: 00...99.**
Write a program that prints numbers from `0` to `99`.
- Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- The last number should be followed by a new line
- You can only use no more than 2 `print` functions with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

**Task 6: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need.**
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
- The two digits must be different
- Print only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- The last number should be followed by a new line
- You can only use no more than 3 `print` functions with string format
- You can only use no more than 2 loops in your code
- You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module
